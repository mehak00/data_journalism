# Final Project - Mehak Sharma

The data I looked at for this project is for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. This data was obtained from [the Milken Institute's COVID-19 Tracker] (https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org/). The fields in this dataset include Developer/Researcher, Treatment vs. Vaccine	Product, Category, Stage of Development,	Anticipated Next Steps,	Product Description,	Clinical Trials for COVID-19,	Funder,	Published Results, and FDA-Approved Indications. 

For most of these fields, not much cleaning was needed. I noticed some count errors while making pivot tables, which I then fixed by "trimming" certain values as there was an extra space at the end of the value, which prevented it from being categorized and  counted correctly.
