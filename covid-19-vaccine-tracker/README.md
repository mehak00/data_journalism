# Final Project - Mehak Sharma

The data I looked at for this project is for COVID-19 vaccines and treatments. This data was obtained from [the Milken Institute's COVID-19 Tracker](https://covid-19tracker.milkeninstitute.org/). The Milken Institute’s FasterCures project is tracking hundreds of potential COVID-19 treatments and vaccines. For each candidate, the project’s database lists its category (e.g., DNA-based vaccines, cell-based therapies, et cetera), a brief description, its stage of development, “anticipated next steps,” funders, published results, FDA-Approved indications, and more.


For most of these fields, not much cleaning was needed. I noticed some count errors while making pivot tables, which I then fixed by "trimming" certain values as there was an extra space at the end of the value, which prevented it from being categorized and  counted correctly.

Breakdown by Vaccine/Treatment Category


Relationship between Category and Development Stage

I created a pivot table to visualize the relationship between category and development stage.
